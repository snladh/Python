ATM Simulation Coding
Scenario:
You are tasked with developing a basic ATM simulation using Python. The ATM should be able to handle five customers, each with their unique account number, balance, and PIN code. Additionally, users should have the ability to change their PIN. Write a program that provides the following functionality:
Requirements:
Customer Details: Predefine details for 5 customers: Account number (e.g., 1001, 1002, etc.) Balance (e.g., 5000, 10000, etc.) PIN code (e.g., 1234, 5678, etc.) Store these details in a suitable data structure (like a dictionary). Basic Functions: The ATM should provide the following functionalities:
Login: Prompt the user to enter their account number and PIN. Allow access if the details match. Provide three attempts for entering the correct PIN.
Check Balance: Display the current balance of the logged-in user.
Withdraw Money: Allow the user to withdraw an amount. Check if the amount is valid (greater than 0 and less than or equal to the balance). Deduct the amount from the balance.
Deposit Money: Allow the user to deposit an amount. Add the amount to the user's balance.
Change PIN: Allow the user to update their PIN. Steps: Verify the current PIN. Prompt the user to enter a new PIN and confirm it. If confirmed, update the PIN.
Logout: Allow the user to log out and return to the login screen for another customer.
Error Handling: Display appropriate error messages for invalid inputs, such as incorrect account number, incorrect PIN, insufficient balance, etc. Ensure the user cannot withdraw more than the current balance.
Exit: Provide an option to terminate the ATM program.
